# Partner API

## Typical Use Cases üîÄ
*(No explicit anchor needed)*

### Working with Orders:
- [Create an Order](#creating-orders)
- Check the status ‚Äì usually via a [webhook notification](#webhook-notifications-for-order-statuses), although in some cases you can explicitly request the [status of a group of orders](#retrieving-orders)
- Sometimes you need to [cancel an order](#canceling-orders) before it enters processing

### Sometimes You May Need to Check:
- [Pairs, Rates, Limits, and Commissions](#retrieving-current-pairs-rates-minimummaximum-amounts-and-reserves)
- [MineCoin Account Balances](#retrieving-minecoin-balances)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start (Method Collection with Signature Automation in Postman)
For your convenience, we have created a collection in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) that replicates all API methods. You can test its functionality and experiment with the requests.
1. In Postman, select the "Import file" menu item (for example, on the "Home" tab).
2. Go to the "Link" tab and import the following URL:  
   `https://api.postman.com/collections/6328473-21626561-38fb-44cd-8c82-e24bc4047d2a?access_key=PMAT-01HT2VGXW98N3BSTC169WZ0HC7`
3. Hover over the imported collection, select the "Variables" tab, and enter your configuration in the "Current value" column.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Financial Control
For some pairs, order recalculation applies. This means that if an incorrect amount is received from the client, the order is recalculated and executed based on the received amount. When receiving the final status of an order (preferably via webhook), you must use the amounts provided in the API response in your system. It is unacceptable to rely on the credited amount without verifying the sums.

Also, we recommend regularly reconciling the balances from our API with those in your system.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Network Loss Control
Although rare, the connection between servers may drop, so you need to validate that the response data is as expected:
1. If the request is processed correctly, the client will receive a 2xx HTTP code. Otherwise, an error occurred, and the [response body contains its details](#standard-error-response-for-all-requests). Alternatively, you can check the `success` parameter in the JSON response body (1 if the request succeeded, otherwise 0).
2. The API always responds with JSON. If you do not receive valid JSON, you cannot be sure whether your request succeeded or was lost in transit. For critical requests (for example, payouts), verify such requests by any available means and do not consider the request completed (or failed) until you receive explicit confirmation:
    - In some cases, you can send a follow-up API request to check the status. For instance, if you made a payout request and are unsure if it went through, you can [check for the existence and status of the order](#retrieving-orders).
    - If automated verification is not possible, contact our technical support. Our support is very responsive, so in such exceptional situations, you will receive an answer as quickly as possible üí™

## Security üõ°
For security, two keys are used: the authorization key and the signature key. Both keys are generated by the user in the personal account under the "API Settings" tab.

### API Authorization
For API authorization, an authorization key is used and must be provided as a header:
```js
Authorization: "Bearer {{AuthKey}}"
```

### Signing API Requests
For security reasons, API requests require a signature that hashes the request body using the signature key. The generated signature must be passed as a header:
```js
X-Signature: "{{Signature}}"
```

The signature is generated using the algorithm:
```php
hmac(sha256(SignatureKey, Request.Body))
```
(Where **SignatureKey** is your signature key, and **Request.Body** is the body of the specific request.)

If the request body is absent (GET requests), the signature is generated from an empty string.

üì¢ A similar [approach to signing requests](#verifying-the-authenticity-of-webhook-notifications) is used when sending webhook notifications from our side. The difference is that in API requests from you to us, you generate the signature, and we verify it. When sending webhook notifications from us to you, the signature is generated by us, and you verify it.

‚ö°Ô∏è For quick testing, we recommend using [our Postman collection](#‚ö°Ô∏è-quick-start-method-collection-with-signature-automation-in-postman).

### Allowed IP Addresses
For enhanced security, access to the API methods is allowed only from certain IP addresses (configured in your personal account under the "API Settings" tab).

‚ö†Ô∏è You can specify the symbol "**\***" to allow access from all IP addresses, but we **strongly advise against doing this in production**.

---

## Headers for All API Requests
```json
{
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{auth_key}}",
    "X-Signature": "{{signature}}"
}
```

## Standard Error Response for All Requests:
```json
{
    "success": 0,
    "code": "4xx-5xx",
    "errors": {
        "message": "{{error_message}}",
        "details": {}
    }
}
```

## Schema of the "Order" Object (Used in Many API Requests and Responses)
```js
{
    "order_id": "{{Partner system order ID}}",
    "inbound": {
        "currency": "{{Currency being sent}}",
        "account": "{{Sender's account}}",
        "amount": "{{Amount being sent}}",
        "amount_initial": "{{Initial send amount; used in API responses}}",
        "txid": "{{Incoming transaction ID; used in API responses}}", //nullable
        "code": "{{Payment code; used in API requests}}" //nullable        
    },
    "outbound": {
        "currency": "{{Payout currency}}",
        "account": "{{Recipient's account}}",
        "amount": "{{Payout amount}}",
        "amount_initial": "{{Initial payout amount; used in API responses}}", 
        "txid": "{{Outgoing transaction ID; used in API responses}}", //nullable
        "memo": "{{Cryptocurrency wallet memo; used in API requests}}" //nullable       
    },
    "is_customer_confirmation_need": "{{Flag indicating if customer confirmation is required; used in API responses}}",
    "rate": "{{Exchange rate; used in API responses}}",
    "rate_initial": "{{Initial exchange rate; used in API responses}}",
    "rate_type": "{{Type of exchange rate: inbound|outbound; used in API responses}}",
    "comment": "{{Order comment (optional)}}",
    "status": "{{Operation status: 'new|processing|incoming_unconfirmed|incoming_confirmed|moderation|error|canceled|success'; used in API responses}}",
    "created_at": "{{Creation time in ISO 8601 format; used in API responses}}",
    "updated_at": "{{Update time in ISO 8601 format; used in API responses}}"
}
```

### What is `amount_initial`?
When [initiating an order](#creating-orders), `amount_initial` is not provided. You must specify either `outbound.amount` or `inbound.amount`, which will then be immediately fixed as `amount_initial`.

Reasons why `amount` and `amount_initial` may differ:
- An order is created for CARDUAH ‚Üí BTC for 0.1 BTC. The calculation determines that 100k UAH is required, but only 50k was paid; the engine recalculates the order and pays out 0.05 BTC.
- Occasionally, slight discrepancies occur due to backend recalculations.

### Possible Values for the `status` Parameter

| **status**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **new**                  | New order, queued and not yet processed.                                                                                                                    |
| **processing**           | Order is being processed, awaiting action from the user.                                                                                                    |
| **incoming_unconfirmed** | In some cases, after the client makes a payment, the system sees the transaction on the network, but the funds have not yet arrived. This status indicates that the incoming payment is pending. |
| **incoming_confirmed**   | The client‚Äôs payment has been confirmed.                                                                                                                    |
| **moderation**           | Order is under review by a service manager. (Rare status.)                                                                                                  |
| ‚ùì **error**             | There is an error in the order. This status is not final; please contact technical support for clarification.                                               |
| üèÅ **canceled**          | Order has been canceled (by the user or system). In pairs with MineCoin, this status means that the order has reached a final state, funds were not sent, and have been returned to the MineCoin account. Possible reasons include incorrect recipient details, issuing bank restrictions, or other causes. Once this status is received, you may retry the transaction. |
| üèÅ **success**           | Funds have been paid out; order is completed.                                                                                                               |

üèÅ ‚Äî Final statuses.

‚ùì **error** ‚Äî An unknown exception occurred; please contact support for clarification. Do not retry the transaction.

**Payment Variants Details Depending on the Receiving Payment System**

‚ö†Ô∏è This description is current as of the time of writing and is provided solely as a guide for the integrator. The set of parameters may change.

| **Payment System**        | **Object in payment_variants** | **Description**                                                                                      |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Jumbo**                 | invoice                         | (url) A link to redirect the client to the issued invoice                                          |

**Each element of the "payment_variants" object contains the following parameters:**
- **error** (Mandatory. By default, it is null, meaning no error. Otherwise, it contains a text description of the error that prevents the use of that payment method.)
- One of the following payment details is required:
  - **url**: The URL of the payment system to which the client should be redirected.
  - **number**: The payment details to which the client must manually transfer the payment.
- **note** (An optional textual note to assist developers and simplify the integration process.)

#### Order.details ‚Äî Used in Responses to Provide Additional Details About the Order
Currently, for payouts from some payment systems, receipts are generated in `Order.details.receipts`. Clients can download these receipts to confirm that the payment was made.
```js
{
    "details": {
        "comment_for_client": "{{comment_for_client}}",
        "payout_receipts": {
            "{{payment_system_transaction_id}}": {
                "pdf": "{{https://************.pdf}}",
                "jpeg": "{{https://************.jpeg}}",
                "amount": {{amount}}
            },
            ...
        },
        ... 
    }
}
```

## API Methods üî¢

### Retrieving Orders {#retrieving-orders}
‚ö†Ô∏è We do not recommend using this method frequently to avoid delays. For notifications about order status changes, please use the "[webhook notifications for order statuses](#webhook-notifications-for-order-statuses)" tool.

**[GET] /{{API_PARTNERS_PREFIX}}/orders?ids={{id1}},{{id2}},...&page={{pages_count}}&per_page={{items_count}}**
- **ids**: Comma-separated partner order IDs. You may specify a single order.
- **page**: Optional parameter specifying the page number to retrieve.
- **per_page**: Number of items per page.

#### Successful Response (200)
```js
{
    "success": 1,
    "code": 200,
    "data": {
        "total": {{Total number of items in the selection}},
        "per_page": {{Number of items per page}},
        "page": {{Current page}},
        "orders": {
            "{{Partner order ID}}": {{Order}},
            ...
        }
    }
}
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è See also: [Schema of the "Order" Object](#).

‚ö†Ô∏è If no orders match your query parameters, the `data.orders` field in the response will be an empty object. Therefore, if you are using this method to poll the status of orders (which is highly discouraged but understood in certain business cases), you should verify the presence of your orders within the keys of the `data.orders` object.

---

### Creating Orders {#creating-orders}
This request creates orders. After an order is created, you must [make a payment using the provided payment details](#) from the response to complete it.

**[POST] /{{API_PARTNERS_PREFIX}}/orders**
```js
{
    "orders": [
        {{Order}},
        ...
    ]
}
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è See also: [Schema of the "Order" Object](#).

**Please Note:**
1. It is not possible to create an order with the same ID from the same partner.
2. When creating orders, the `inbound.account` field is sometimes not required (for example, in the case of a MineCoin payout).
3. It is acceptable to specify only one of the amounts ‚Äì either the amount to be received or the payout amount (`inbound.amount` or `outbound.amount`). The other amount is calculated automatically based on rates and commissions.
4. It is mandatory to include [extra parameters](#) with data about the order and the user in your system.
5. You may include a "comment" field for your convenience, but the recipient will not see it. This field will be displayed in the order information via the API and in your personal account.

üí° If you have a special case where the order ID does not need to match the ID in your system, the API can generate a random `{{order_id}}`. To do this, specify it as follows:
```js
{
    "order_id": "auto-uid"
}
```

#### Successful Response (200)
```js
{
    "success": 1,
    "code": 200,
    "data": {
        "invalid": {
            "{{Partner order ID}}": "{{Error message}}",
            ...
        },
        "created": {
            "{{Partner order ID}}": {{Order}},
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

---

### Confirming Order Payment
‚ÑπÔ∏è Orders can only be confirmed if they are in the "new" status. Confirmation is necessary if the `is_customer_confirmation_need` flag in the [Order object](#) is set to `true`.

**[PUT] /{{API_PARTNERS_PREFIX}}/orders/confirm-by-customer**
```js
{
    "ids": [
        "{{Partner order ID}}",
        ...
    ]
}
```

#### Successful Response (200)
```js
{
    "success": 1,
    "code": 200,
    "data": {
        "invalid": {
            "{{Partner order ID}}": "{{Reason why confirmation failed}}",
            ...
        },
        "confirmed": {
            "{{Partner order ID}}": {{Order}},
            ...
        }
    }
}
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è See also: [Schema of the "Order" Object](#).

---

### Canceling Orders {#canceling-orders}
In certain critical cases, partners may need to cancel created orders before the payout process begins.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Cancellation is allowed only for orders in the "new" and "processing" statuses. If the payment process has already begun, cancellation via this API method is not possible. In such cases, please contact our operators immediately.

**[DELETE] /{{API_PARTNERS_PREFIX}}/orders**
```js
{
    "ids": [
        "{{Partner order ID}}",
        ...
    ]
}
```

#### Successful Response (200)
```js
{
    "success": 1,
    "code": 200,
    "data": {
        "invalid": {
            "{{Partner order ID}}": "{{Error message}}",
            ...
        },
        "canceled": {
            "{{Partner order ID}}": {{Order}},
            ...
        }
    }
}
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è See also: [Schema of the "Order" Object](#).

### Retrieving MineCoin Balances {#retrieving-minecoin-balances}
Retrieve the balances of the deposit account in our system (each account is tied to a specific currency).

**[GET] /{{API_PARTNERS_PREFIX}}/balances**

#### Successful Response (200)
```js
{
    "success": 1,
    "code": 200,
    "data": {
        "BTC": {{Balance amount}},
        "USDT": {{Balance amount}},
        "UAH": {{Balance amount}}
    }
}
```

### Retrieving Current Pairs, Rates, Minimum/Maximum Amount Limits, and Reserves {#retrieving-current-pairs-rates-minimummaximum-amounts-and-reserves}
**[GET] /{{API_PARTNERS_PREFIX}}/pairs?names={{CurrencyA}}:{{CurrencyB}},{{CurrencyX}}:{{CurrencyY}},...&inbound_currencies={{CurrencyA}},{{CurrencyB}},...&outbound_currencies={{CurrencyA}},{{CurrencyB}}**
- **names**: Optional parameter, comma-separated pair names in the format: "{{CurrencyA}}:{{CurrencyB}}".
- **inbound_currencies**: Optional parameter, comma-separated inbound currency codes.
- **outbound_currencies**: Optional parameter, comma-separated outbound currency codes.

                "rate": {{Exchange rate of this currency relative to the other in the pair. Usually one rate will be 1 and the other a fractional number}},
                "is_account_required": {{Indicates whether the 'account' field is required when creating an order}}
            },
            "rate": {{Overall exchange rate for the currency pair}},
            "min_amount": {{Minimum amount of the first currency available for processing}},
            "max_amount": "{{Maximum amount of the first currency available for processing}}",

        },
        ...
    }
}
```

## Webhook Notifications for Order Statuses {#webhook-notifications-for-order-statuses} üì¢
You can (and we strongly recommend) subscribe a URL on your server to receive notifications about order status changes.

The "***{{Callback URL}}***" is specified in your personal account under the "API Settings" tab.  
When an order's status changes, the system will send an HTTP request using the ***POST*** method to your ***{{Callback URL}}*** with the request body containing the **Order** object.

Your server must respond with a **2XX** status code. If this does not happen, the webhook will be retried after a delay. With each subsequent failure, the delay will increase, and the webhook will be retried. At the time of writing, we have set 10 notification retries; however, this may change without prior notice.

üí° For testing webhooks, you can use the excellent third-party tool [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) which provides you with a URL to receive notifications and monitor them through your browser.

### Verifying the Authenticity of Webhook Notifications {#verifying-the-authenticity-of-webhook-notifications}
For security purposes (to verify that the webhook was sent from an official source), webhook notifications include a signature that hashes the request body using the signature key.

You can (and we strongly recommend) verify the signature on your side by comparing the signature received from the header (`X-Signature`) with the one generated on your end.

The signature is generated automatically using the exact same algorithm as in [Signing API Requests](#).
